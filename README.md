# TripleTen_projects
Projects I worked on while attending the Data Analysis TripleTen Bootcamp.


| Project number | Title | Description |
| :-----------: | ----------- |----------- |
| 1 | [NYC Airbnb Data Analysis](https://github.com/Wilfredog266/NYC-Airbnb-Listings-Data-Analysis)| This project was developed to analyze Airbnb listing data from Manhattan, NYC, to derive actionable business insights for prospective property investors. |
| 2 | [Business Analytics Project](https://github.com/Wilfredog266/business-analytics-conversion-cohort-project) | This project simulates the role of a junior analyst at an e-commerce company. Using raw transaction logs of user activity, I analyzed how well the website converts product views into purchases and how long customers are retained over time.  |
| 3 | A/A/B Test Analysis | The project task was to study the sales funnel and analyze the results of an A/B test for a food startup. |
| 4 | Machine Learning Customer Interaction Strategies | The project task was to help a chain of fitness clubs develop a customer retention strategy. |
